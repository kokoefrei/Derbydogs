                <p>The German shepherd (also known as the Alsatian Shepherd or Alsatian Shepherd) is a breed of dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), named after his country of origin, Germany, where it appeared at the end of the nineteenth century. The International Cynological Federation recognizes it under the name of Deutscher Schäferhund, which suggests that for thousands of years animals close to German shepherds and their Belgian or Dutch cousins have existed in this region of Europe

                <p>The chihuahua (in Spanish chihuahueño or also chihuahua) is the smallest dog in the world1. Its name comes from the homonymous Mexican state. It sometimes weighs less than one kilogram but the ideal range is between 1.5 and 3 kg. The standard does not allow dogs of higher weight.

                <p>The Siberian husky is a medium sized working dog. The body is moderately compact, its proportions and shape reflect a balance between the qualities sought for a sled dog: power, speed and endurance. The Siberian husky, in good condition, is endowed with a firm and well developed musculature without unnecessary weight. The well-furnished brush tail evokes its northern heredity, it is worn above the sickle-shaped back.
